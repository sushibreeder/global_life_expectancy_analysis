# Impact of Socioeconomic Factors on Global Life Expectancy

This project analyzes WHO and UN data for 193 countries from 2000 to 2016 to understand how socioeconomic, healthcare, and environmental factors influence life expectancy.

## Objective

- Identify key drivers of life expectancy using statistical modeling.
- Evaluate health access, income, education, and environmental quality.
- Test hypotheses on the effect of healthcare spending and clean water.

## Key Features

- Missing value imputation (median-based)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and pair plots
- Model comparison: Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet
- Evaluation using RMSE
- Model assumptions diagnostics: residual plots, VIF, normality tests

## Tools Used

- Python: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `statsmodels`
- Statistical Techniques: Regression, Hypothesis Testing, VIF Analysis
- Visualization: Correlation matrix, KDE, box plots

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `scripts/`: Modularized Python scripts for each step
- `figures/`: Plots and visualizations
